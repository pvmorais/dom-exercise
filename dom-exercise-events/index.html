    <!-- Method 1: Attach functions’ attributes directly on your HTML elements -->
    <button onclick="alert('Hello World')">Click Me</button>
        <!-- This solution is less than ideal because we’re cluttering our HTML with JavaScript. Also, we can only have 1 “onclick” event per element. -->
    <!-- Method 2: Set the “on_event_” property on the DOM object in your JavaScript-->
    <button id="btn">Click Me</button>
        <!-- This is a little better. We’ve moved the JS out of the HTML and into a JS file, but we still have the problem that a DOM element can only have 1 “onclick” property. -->
    <!-- Method 3: Attach event listeners to the nodes in your JavaScript -->
    <button id="btn3">Click Me Too</button>
        <!-- Now, we maintain separation of concerns, and we also allow multiple event listeners if the need arises. Method 3 is much more flexible and powerful, though it is a bit more complex to set up. -->

    <!-- Note that all 3 of these methods can be used with named functions like so: -->
    <!-- METHOD 1 -->
    <button onclick="alertFunction()">CLICK ME BABY</button>
